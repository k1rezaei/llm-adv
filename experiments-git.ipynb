    "\n",
    "1. Given a query $x$, we generate fictional advertisers $\\text{ad}_1, \\text{ad}_2, ..., \\text{ad}_n$ with their ads.\n",
    "2. We sample bids $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$ from a lognormal distribution (mean and std of this should be adjusted w.r.t. values of $q_i$)\n",
    "3. We run different mechanism for this LLM query/ads configuration, *i.e.*, $(x, \\{ad_i\\}_{i=1}^{n}, \\{b_i\\}_{i=1}^{n}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    + single-allocation segment auction with replacement\n",
    "    + single-allocation segment auction without replacement\n",
    "    + multi-allocation greedy mechanism\n",
    "    + naive (i) mechanism where $y = y_{\\text{orig}} + \\text{ad}_1 + \\text{ad}_2 + ... + \\text{ad}_k$\n",
    "    + naive (ii) mechanism where we run 2nd price auction in each round\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We run $N$ times each of the above mechanisms as they are randomized, we report the expectation of the following metrics:\n",
    "    + social welfare (sum of $v_{i_t} q_{i_t}$)\n",
    "    + revenue (sum of $p_{i_t}$)\n",
    "    + relevance (sum of $q_{i_t}$)\n",
    "    + output quality; we think of the following metrics\n",
    "        + distance of output including ad to the original output -- measures if the output including ad answers the query or not.\n",
    "        + we ask an off-the-shelf LLM to evaluate the output including ads has too much advertisement or not, probably asking it to rate from $1$ to $10$.\n",
    "        + we ask an off-the-shelf LLM to evaluate paragraphs are coherent or not, probably asking it to rate from $1$ to $10$.\n",
    "\n",

    "There are several design choices that we consider:\n",
    "+ How long each segment should be, we first run with a paragraph.\n",
    "+ dependant/independent segment auction\n",
    "+ distribution that $x_i$ (allocation vector) comes from. Since we use RAG-based aggregation function on bids to get the allocation vector, we need to control how this allocation vector looks like, *e.g.*, we were thinking of putting some ratio for $\\frac{x_{\\max}}{x_{\\min}}$.\n",
    "+ how many segments should we consider? we put $k=3$ in our experiments, this further gives us the results for $k = 1, 2$.\n",
