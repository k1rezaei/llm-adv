#### Auction statistics
Here we have $3$ different scenarios ($500$ runs each).

Note that:

+ we divide SW by maximum possible SW $(\max_i q_i b_i \cdot \text{count}_{\text{segments}})$
+ Revenue by maximum possible revenue $(\max_i b_i \cdot \text{count}_{\text{segments}})$
+ Relevency by maximum releveance $(\max_i q_i \cdot \text{count}_{\text{segments}})$

<!-- Standard deviation of above metrics over $500$ runs of the randomized algorithm is as follows:

#### Quality of output
Here are the results regarding quality of output: we measure the relevancy of output (including 3 segments with ad) to a set of outputs without any ads.
Higher score means more relevancy to original output, thereby indicating higher quality.


At this table, we measure the relevency of each individual segment to the orignal outputs.

|   Mechanism                       |   $1$-st segment  |	$2$-nd segment  |   $3$-rd segment  |

At this one, we measure the relevancy of first $k$ segments of the modified output to the origian outputs.

### Multi-Alloc vs Single-Alloc


We compare quality of output of three-segment single-allocation without replacement with multi-allocation ($k=3$) mechanism. LLMs should show better management of output when all advertisers are given in one query, comparing to segment-wise generation.
